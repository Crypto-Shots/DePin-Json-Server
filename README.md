# DePIN JSON Server

DePIN JSON Server (DJS) allows you to control your Hive Witness running on a decentralized network (e.g. Flux) by sending it commands as on-chain custom JSON transactions on the Hive blockchain.

## Overview

- Containerization:
DJS and the Hive Witness run together in a single Docker container, ensuring a self-contained environment where configuration values (e.g. keys) are setup before the container is deployed.

- Secure Command Execution:
No sensitive data shall ever be broadcasted on-chain. Send only non-sensitive command identifiers in the payload!
For instance, you can trigger actions like starting synchronization or updating the witness using commands defined in the hive-witness-automation documentation:
https://github.com/Crypto-Shots/hive-witness-automation

- On-Chain Data Consumption:
The server consumes blockchain data via HAF, which is available on all Hive nodes. Under the hood, we query operations using the following API: https://api.hive.blog/hafah-api/blocks/94752093/operations?operation-types=18&path-filter=value.id=djs-server

- Modular & Extensible Integration:
The integration interface is designed to be agnostic. Currently, it dispatches payloads to a module that executes commands on the same machine where DJS runs, but this project can easily be cloned/extended to process different on-chain data types and trigger diverse actions (for example, on-chain game data).

## Usage

##### Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

##### Configure DJS
  - Edit src/config to set up:
    - Admin account list (in users.js)
    - Discord webhook for notifications
    - Healthcheck URLs for:
        - DJS itself
        - Chain data consumption
        - Witness Node status (1. up and 2. functioning properly)
    - Logs forwarding endpoint

##### Start the Server

```
npm start
```
*TODO: replace with pm2 start ecostystem.config.js*

##### Broadcast Commands

Use JSON Doctor (Open Source) to broadcast on-chain custom JSON commands:
https://jsondoctor.github.io

Security Notice: to be on the safe side, do NOT enter your private key on that website.
By default, it will prompt you to sign the transaction using Hive Keychain. Make sure Hive Keychain is installed in your browser.

## WORK IN PROGRESS

- Read authorized users from ${masterAccounts[index]}/djs-authorized-users
- Allow commands execution only from master accounts and authorized users
- Use pm2 (or npm forever is enough if no reboots ever)
- Rotate Hive nodes using https://beacon.peakd.com (configurable endpoint)
- Make Discord webhook configurable
- Various Healthckecks support
- Logs forwarding support
- Production readiness checklist
- Add useful npm commands?


## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

- crypto-shots.com/witness UI:
    - JSON Doctor GitHub fork as base
    - dropdown for posting user -> masters in config + pull authorized users from permlink
    - input field for command (cmd attribute in json)
    - commands history using this library as SDK to confirm on-chain read
    - server output -> from logs forwarder

- Support command as reply to a root blog post? (risk of nesting replies)
